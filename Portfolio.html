                        <p>My goal for this project was to create a 3-D model for Possum Kingdom Lake that included the lake bottom and surrounding shores. This section of the lake was selected as an area of interest due to the
                            unique topography. Two large cliffs create what is know as Hell's Gate. One side of Hell's Gate is an Island with steep slopes while the other narrowly connects to land. The DEM was acquired from TNRIS, Texas Natural
                            Resource Information System. The 1 meter isobaths for the lake came
                            from Brazos River Authority. Each isobath represented a change in 1 meter of depth. To reduce the number of contour lines used to interpolate a DTM, Digital Terrain Model, surface I selected isobaths where modulo 10
                            equaled 0. I then clipped
                            land DEM with a polygon of the lake. As a result the lake surface would equal 0. Using the Raster Calculator the DTM was added to the clipped DEM only where the DEM was equal to 0. Using this new raster surface with the
                            Qgis2threejs plugin
                            a 3-D model was generated along with HTML to imbed the model.  <a href="assets\PossumKingdomLake__\pk_3d.html">Click here to view the 3-D Model.</a></p>

                        <p>The goal of this script was to take a csv, clean the data, and insert it into a PostGIS database. Several Python libraries were used including pandas, geopandas, sqlalchemy, geoalchemy. Pandas and geopandas are
                            are used for data analysis and manipulation. Geopandas makes using pandas easier with spatial datatypes. Sqlalchemy gives python applications sql toolkits. Geoalchemy is an open source spatial extension for sqlalchemy.
                             In the future this can be modified to take a variety of inputs. One of particular interst would be taking stream data or data requested from an API that could rewrite or update previous data.</p>
